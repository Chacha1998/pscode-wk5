// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Add x + y to = z
Ex1: sum = 2+2 = 4

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If number is divisible by 2 it is even or else it is odd
Ex2: if (x % 2 == 0)
Return 'even'
Else
Return 'odd'

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Ex 3: 

	5numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
	average_5numbers = sum(5numbers) / 5
	min_5numbers = min(5numbers)
	max_5numbers = max(5numbers)
	print ("Average: ", average_5numbers)
	print ("Min: ", min_5numbers)
	print ("Max: ", max_5numbers)
